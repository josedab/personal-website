# Hello world!

Hi there! :wave:

My name is José David, and you ended up on my site. I wanted to welcome you to the site; I hope you found what you were looking for :smile:.

## Motivation
The main reason I decided to start a blog was to document thoughts, ideas, interests I have daily. 

I usually write these ideas on Evernote. However, after reading [Max Stoiber](https://mxstbr.com/) notes about [Working in public](https://notes.mxstbr.com/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=Work_in_public)), I got inspired to start sharing them publicly.

Also, I am a firm believer in teaching what I learn (or in this case writing it), as it is an excellent way to recall your learnings.

Students **who spend time teaching** what they’ve learned go on to show **better understanding** and knowledge retention than students who simply spend the same time re-studying.

## Content of this site
This site will contain mostly information/challenges I face in the Software Engineering field. Most of the content will be technical to some degree, although if a lot of code is involved, I am likely pointing the work to the specific GitHub repository.

## Content frequency
I aim to write at least once a month: I put a low entry requirement to encourage myself to have this alive and have it up to date :sweat_smile:. If I like this writing adventure, I will reevaluate the frequency of it. For the moment, I want to focus this as a writing/learning experience and not an obligation.
